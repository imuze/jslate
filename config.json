    "intro_text": "This is an alpha version of the iMuze API. The iMuze API lets you generate songs on demand. A song is based on a melody. A melody is unique. Melodies can be interpreted by any iMuze arrangements, classical, rock, hip-hop etc ... </br> You can access existing arrangements either by ids (after listing them) or by tags. You will need to register as a developer before using the API."
